        What is a closure? This question is one of the most frequent interview questions where JavaScript is involved. If you
        answer this question quickly and knowledgeably you'll look like a great candidate. We know you want to know it all so
        let's dive right in!

        &emsp;Answer: &emsp;The official definition of a closure from MDN is, "A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical
        environment within which that function was declared."
        <br>&emsp;A closure is when an inner function uses, or changes, variables in an outer function.
        Closures in JavaScript are incredibly important
        in terms of the creativity, flexibility and <strong>security</strong> of your code.
